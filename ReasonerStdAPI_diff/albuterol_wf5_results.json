This factor is converted to an active form by factor XIa, which excises the activation peptide and thus generates a heavy chain and a light chain held together by one or more disulfide bonds. The role of this activated factor IX in the blood coagulation cascade is to activate factor X to its active form through interactions with Ca+2 ions, membrane phospholipids, and factor VIII. Alterations of this gene, including point mutations, insertions and deletions, cause factor IX deficiency, which is a recessive X-linked disorder, also called hemophilia B or Christmas disease. Alternative splicing results in multiple transcript variants encoding different isoforms that may undergo similar proteolytic processing. [provided by RefSeq, Sep 2015].",

            "description": "The protein encoded by this gene is a plasma membrane G protein-coupled receptor that senses small changes in circulating calcium concentration. The encoded protein couples this information to intracellular signaling pathways that modify parathyroid hormone secretion or renal cation handling, and thus this protein plays an essential role in maintaining mineral ion homeostasis. Mutations in this gene are a cause of familial hypocalciuric hypercalcemia, neonatal severe hyperparathyroidism, and autosomal dominant hypocalcemia. [provided by RefSeq, Aug 2017].",
